# Starter Project for a GraphQL Server with Prisma and Auth0

This project was created using the `typescript-graphql-server` boilerplate via `prisma init`. Read more about the idea behind GraphQL boilerplates [here](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-boilerplates-graphql-create-how-to-setup-a-graphql-project-6428be2f3a5).

This documentation uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) for all dependency management examples, but you can safely substitute all `yarn` commands with `npm` if you wish.

## Features

- **Scalable GraphQL server:** The server uses [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) which is based on Apollo Server & Express
- **Static type generation**: TypeScript types for GraphQL queries & mutations are generated in a build step
- **Authentication**: Signup and login workflows are ready to use for your users
- **GraphQL database:** Includes GraphQL database binding to [Prisma](https://www.prismagraphql.com) (running on MySQL)
- **Tooling**: Out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) & [query performance tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing)
- **Extensible**: Simple and flexible [data model](./database/datamodel.graphql) – easy to adjust and extend
- **No configuration overhead**: Preconfigured [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-config) setup

## Documentation

This repository follows the [Conventional Commits Specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/). You can use `yarn release` followed by `git push --follow-tags origin master` when you want to cut a release. See the [`standard-version` documentation](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for more information.

If you want to be able to generate GitHub Releases based on commits you need to follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/releaser-tools/tree/master/packages/conventional-github-releaser) and use `yarn github-release` every time you want to release a version.

### Commands

* `yarn start` starts GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000`
* `yarn dev` starts GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000` _and_ opens GraphQL Playground
* `yarn playground` opens the GraphQL Playground for the `projects` from [`.graphqlconfig.yml`](./.graphqlconfig.yml)
* `yarn prisma <subcommand>` gives access to local version of Prisma CLI (e.g. `yarn prisma deploy`)

> **Note**: It is recommended that you use `yarn dev` during development as it will give you access to the GraphQL API or your server (defined by the [application schema](./src/schema.graphql)) as well as to the Prisma API directly (defined by the [Prisma database schema](./generated/prisma.graphql)). If you're starting the server with `yarn start`, you'll only be able to access the API of the application schema.
